# Hack-in-India

This app is demonstarting 2 topics from 9th class chemistry of CBSE, i.e., Structure of an Atom and Separation of 2 liquids. App is using Vuforia for ground planes technology.

When you start the app it has a next button which switches between the 2 gameobjects, at first the separation of 2 liquids is active and can be augmented by clicking on the screen. if next is clicked, then structure of atom gets activated deactivating the other one. When structure of atom activates, there is option of entering Atomic number (Z value) through which atom augments and can further be edited in a range of atomic number 1 to 20. Respective to Z value, the details are shown in the adjacent floating text (right side to the atom).

Demo video of how the app work is shown in the following:
